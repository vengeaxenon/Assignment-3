<h1>Sundown with Love</h1>
<p>Started in 2013, Sundown with Love is a part of Sundown Marathon’s Charity outreach<br>campaign. As the saying goes “not all heroes wear capes.” Every year, Sundown with Love<br>aims to gather the running community for one simple reason – to give back to the<br>community.
<br><br>
This year, OSIM Sundown Marathon Singapore aims to champion the cause of inclusivity in<br>sports and the wider community and will lead by example to contribute funds to the ongoing<br>charity initiative – Sundown with Love. The beneficiaries are <a href="https://sdsc.org.sg/">Singapore Disability Sports<br>Council</a> and <a href="https://www.spmf.org.sg/">The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund</a>. For every race slot purchased, $1<br>of the registration fee will be donated to the two beneficiaries, and runners will also have the<br>opportunity to donate additional funds to the causes via the website.
<br><br>
Show your support by making a donation, or join us as Sundown with Love ambassadors to<br>be a fundraiser yourself here! Together, we hope to contribute as one running community in<br>helping the less fortunate. You can be a hero to someone!
