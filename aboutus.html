<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Sundown Marathon which begins in Singapore in 2008 will expand its footprint in China<br>and to the US in 2019. As Sundown partners with more event organisers around the<br>world, it hopes to leverage on the strength of its partners and race organisers to enhance<br>the experience of its local and international participants.
<br><br>
Asia’s biggest night run, OSIM Sundown Marathon is set to return to Singapore on June 1,<br>2019, under the new event management of Infinitus Productions. Bringing a fresh<br>perspective to Asia’s biggest night run, the team will preserve the unique characteristics<br>that make the race a favourite amongst the running community, and yet expand its focus<br>to highlight inclusivity in sports.

Reflecting on the brand’s success, Max Phua, Director, F4U Pte Ltd says, “the OSIM<br>Sundown Marathon Singapore is our flagship event and we are happy to partner Jeffrey<br>Foo, Director of Infinitus Productions Pte Ltd who was one of the co-founders of Sundown<br>Marathon when we first started.”
<br><br>
“We are thrilled to be working with F4U again and to continue our journey on Sundown<br>Marathon. We look forward to contributing our experience and expertise to this well-loved<br>and established race and to create an unforgettable experience for our runners, returning<br>and new ones alike,” says Jeffrey Foo, Director of Infinitus Productions Pte. Ltd.

This year, the OSIM Sundown Marathon Singapore also aims to champion the cause of<br>inclusivity in sports and the wider community and Infinitus Productions will lead by<br>example and contribute funds to the ongoing charity initiative, Sundown with Love. Some<br>of the beneficiaries include the Singapore Disability Sports Council, The Straits Times<br>School Pocket Money Fund and RunningHour. For every race slot purchased, $1 of the<br>registration fee will be donated to the adopted beneficiaries, and runners will also have the<br>opportunity to donate additional funds to the causes via the official event website.
<br><br>
Phua further commented, “we are really pleased that we can promote sports inclusivity via<br>our brand. We are proud that Infinitus Productions is aligned with us on our objectives as<br>we expand further afield, creating footprints in Southeast Asia, China and to the US.”
<br><br>
Sundown’s partner in China will also implement a plastic plan that aims to reduce plastic<br>waste by 50 percent during such races. “Low carbon represents a healthier, safer, more<br>natural, and more environmental friendly lifestyle. And we are incorporating this lifestyle<br>into Sundown. We hope Sundown China is not only a brand or a race for participants, but<br>also a lifestyle that can make the world a better place,” Zejin Jiu, Busines Director,<br>Sundown China.
<br><br>
“We hope to spread the excitement around Sundown’s races globally to inspire more<br>people to live a healthy lifestyle and share the joys as a Sundown Running Community,”<br>Max Phua, Director of F4U Pte Ltd.

“The overwhelming response that Sundown has acquired over the years is testament that<br>not only are we appealing to the local running scene, but to runners from across the<br>globe. This support has encouraged us to grow the brand on an international level,”
